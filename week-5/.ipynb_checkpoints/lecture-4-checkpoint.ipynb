    "## 1. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture is a foundational design pattern in software engineering, particularly for web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Principles\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Divides application into Model (data/logic), View (interface), and Controller (input processing).\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Enables independent development and maintenance.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use\n",
    "- Ideal for scalable web applications needing clear separation.\n",
    "- Suitable for maintainable projects with frequent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Not to Use\n",
    "- Avoid for simple apps where separation adds unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "- Not recommended if the team lacks MVC expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appropriate Platforms\n",
    "- Web frameworks like Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "- **How Widely Used**: Extensively in e-commerce, finance, healthcare.\n",
    "- **What It’s Used For**: Building scalable, testable web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Overkill for small apps.\n",
    "- **Learning Curve**: Requires pattern familiarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Well-Known Problems\n",
    "- **Tight Coupling**: Poor implementation creates dependencies.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Large datasets can slow unoptimized systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Cybersecurity Incidents\n",
    "- **SQL Injection**: Model input flaws (e.g., early web apps).\n",
    "- **XSS**: View escaping issues (e.g., e-commerce sites).\n",
