## üîê 1. **Defense in Depth**
Apply controls at **multiple layers**:

| Layer              | Control Example                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Network**        | VPC, subnets, NACLs, firewalls (e.g., WAF)     |
| **Endpoint**       | EDR, OS hardening, patching                    |
| **Application**    | Input validation, rate limiting, authz checks  |
| **Data**           | Encryption at rest & in transit, access logging|
| **Monitoring**     | SIEM, alerting (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana)    |
| **Recovery**       | Backups, disaster recovery plans               |

## üîê 2. **Zero Trust Architecture**
Focus on identity and continuous verification:

| Principle                  | Implementation                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Never trust, always verify** | MFA, device posture checks, identity-aware proxies |
| **Least privilege**        | Fine-grained IAM roles and policies    |
| **Micro-segmentation**     | Use service meshes / network ACLs      |
| **Encrypt everywhere**     | mTLS for internal traffic              |
| **Continuous authz**       | Token expiration, adaptive access      |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 3. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**
Integrate security at each SDLC stage:

| Phase         | Security Control                         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Requirements** | Threat modeling, misuse cases          |
| **Design**        | Architecture risk analysis, STRIDE    |
| **Coding**        | Linting, secure coding standards       |
| **Build/Test**    | SAST, DAST, dependency scanning        |
| **Release**       | Secrets scanning, IaC validation       |
| **Deploy**        | Signed builds, automated approvals     |
| **Monitor**       | Runtime security, anomaly detection    |


## üîê 4. **Zero Knowledge Architecture (ZKA)**  
**Goal**: Ensure that service providers or systems have *no access* to user data ‚Äî even during storage, processing, or transmission.

### üß∞ Required Controls for ZKA:

| Layer                | Control Description                                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encryption at rest**   | Use client-side encryption (CSE); providers store only ciphertext |
| **Encryption in transit**| TLS/SSL for all data exchanges (e.g., HTTPS, mTLS)          |
| **Key Management**       | End-user-controlled keys; e.g., HSM-backed BYOK or client-side KMS |
| **Access Control**       | No privileged backdoor access for admins; zero-access policies |
| **Authentication**       | Passwordless auth or multi-party auth with no stored secrets |
| **Auditing**             | Tamper-proof logging of every access attempt to encrypted data |
| **Secure Sharing**       | End-to-end encrypted sharing links or proxy re-encryption     |
| **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** | Use zk-SNARKs/ZKPs where user can prove ownership or rights without revealing data |
| **Local computation**    | Client-side rendering, indexing, and processing (e.g., E2EE messaging apps) |

---

## üîÅ 5. **Adaptive Security Architecture (ASA)**  
**Goal**: Use continuous context and behavioral analysis to *dynamically* adjust defenses in real-time.

### üß∞ Required Controls for ASA:

| Layer                  | Control Description                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Telemetry from endpoints, network, identities (SIEM/SOAR)     |
| **Behavioral Analytics**  | UEBA (User & Entity Behavior Analytics) for anomaly detection |
| **Context-Aware Access** | Risk-based MFA, device posture check, geo-aware policies      |
| **Dynamic Policy Engine** | Policies that adjust based on context and past behavior      |
| **Deception Tech**        | Honeypots or decoy environments for active threat engagement |
| **Automated Response**    | Use SOAR to auto-quarantine, alert, or require re-auth       |
| **Threat Intelligence**   | Feed external and internal intel into risk scoring           |
| **Runtime Protection**    | RASP, WAF, or eBPF-based defense depending on threat levels  |
| **Feedback Loops**        | Learn from attacks and improve rules (e.g., ML + human triage)|
