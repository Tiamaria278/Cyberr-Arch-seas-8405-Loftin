Insider Threat Detection,Monitoring systems to detect malicious or negligent insider behavior.,Uses behavioral baselines and analytics to flag anomalies from authorized users.,Enterprises with sensitive internal data or IP.,"Data leaks, sabotage, and fraud by insiders.",Can raise privacy concerns; false positives.,When user behavior monitoring is legally restricted or not transparent.
Intrusion Detection System (IDS),Monitors network traffic to detect suspicious activity and known threats.,Signature or anomaly-based detection systems inspect packets or system logs.,"Network perimeters, data centers, and critical infrastructure.",Post-breach spread and known exploit attempts.,High false positives; passive—does not block traffic.,If network visibility is limited or active blocking is needed (use IPS instead).
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Biometric Authentication,"Authentication method requiring multiple credentials, including biometric input.","Combines something the user knows, has, and is (e.g., password, token, fingerprint).",Securing login to sensitive systems or apps.,Credential theft and unauthorized access.,User friction; hardware or device dependency.,May be overkill for low-risk systems with no sensitive data.
Network Segmentation,Dividing a network into isolated segments to contain breaches.,"Uses firewalls, VLANs, and ACLs to enforce boundaries between systems.","Critical environments like OT, cloud, and data centers.",Lateral movement after initial breach.,Complex to manage; may require redesign of network architecture.,"Not useful in flat, low-sensitivity networks with limited segmentation needs."
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM),Tools and practices to ensure cloud environments remain secure and compliant.,Continuously scans cloud configurations and compares them to security best practices and policies.,Cloud-native or hybrid cloud environments to detect misconfigurations.,"Unauthorized access, privilege escalations due to misconfiguration.",High false positive rate; requires cloud-specific expertise.,Not applicable in fully on-prem environments.
Content Security Policy (CSP),Browser directive that defines allowed sources for content.,"Restricts loading of scripts, styles, etc., based on developer-defined rules.",Websites to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and code injection.,"Malicious third-party scripts, clickjacking.",Requires careful tuning; may break legitimate content.,Not effective if scripts are already whitelisted and malicious.
Credential Management,"Systems to securely store, retrieve, and rotate user and application credentials.","Uses vaults, encryption, and policies to manage secrets and access keys.","DevOps, cloud, and enterprise environments.","Credential leakage, hardcoded secrets.",Complex setup and maintenance.,Never store secrets manually—should always use credential management.
Data Loss Prevention (DLP),Technology that monitors and controls the movement of sensitive data.,"Uses pattern matching, rules, and tagging to detect and block data exfiltration.","Email, endpoints, cloud, and data storage systems.",Unintentional leaks and insider threats.,May impact productivity; false positives.,When data classification is poorly defined.
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR),Security solutions that monitor and analyze endpoint activity.,Collects telemetry data and uses behavioral analytics to detect threats.,"Desktops, laptops, servers in enterprises.","Advanced persistent threats, malware, lateral movement.",High resource usage; alerts can be noisy.,On unmanaged or legacy systems with limited resources.
PKI Encryption,Public Key Infrastructure enables secure data transmission and authentication using asymmetric encryption.,Uses a pair of public and private keys and digital certificates to validate identities and encrypt data.,"Securing communications, digital signatures, and certificates.","Man-in-the-middle attacks, spoofing, unauthorized access.",Complex to deploy and manage; requires certificate lifecycle management.,Not suitable for bulk data encryption due to computational overhead.
Privileged Access Management (PAM),Security strategy for controlling and monitoring access to privileged accounts.,"Grants time-limited, monitored access to critical systems; logs and audits usage.",Managing administrator and root access in enterprises.,Abuse of high-privilege accounts and insider threats.,Requires tight integration and can be difficult to enforce at scale.,Not needed for environments without elevated privilege tiers.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC),Access control method where permissions are assigned based on roles.,Users inherit permissions through assigned roles instead of individual grants.,"Enterprise systems, databases, cloud platforms.",Over-permissioning and unauthorized access.,Rigid structure; requires frequent updates as org roles evolve.,Highly dynamic or ad hoc access environments.
SHA-256 Hashing,Cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit fixed output from input data.,Applies a one-way function that is collision-resistant and deterministic.,"Password storage, file integrity, digital signatures.","Tampering, hash collision attacks.",Does not protect against rainbow table attacks unless salted.,Never use alone for password security—combine with salting.
Salting,Adding random data to inputs before hashing to prevent hash matching attacks.,Appends a unique random string to each password before hashing.,Password protection and storage.,Rainbow table and hash collision attacks.,Requires proper storage of the salt value alongside the hash.,Ineffective if not truly random or reused across users.
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) with Real-Time Log Analysis,"Centralized platform for collecting, analyzing, and correlating security events and logs.","Aggregates logs from across systems and uses rules, correlation engines, and ML to identify threats.","Enterprises for threat detection, compliance, and incident response.",Delayed breach detection and blind spots in security posture.,High setup and tuning complexity; false positives.,Small environments without the scale or expertise to manage SIEM.
