,Definition,How it Works,Usage,Prevents,Disadvantages,When Not to Use
Initial Access,Gaining an initial foothold within a network or system.,"Methods include phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.",First stage in most attack chains to breach perimeter defenses.,"With MFA, phishing training, patching, and WAFs.",Often hard to detect due to legitimate-looking entry.,"Not applicable—this is an attacker tactic, not a control."
Execution,Running malicious code on a system.,"May use scripts, payloads, macros, or binary files.",To establish persistence or take control of systems post-breach.,With endpoint protection and execution policy controls.,Can appear as legitimate admin activity.,Not applicable—this is an attacker tactic.
Persistence,Maintaining long-term access to a system after initial compromise.,"Backdoors, autoruns, registry changes, or credential planting.",Used by attackers to survive reboots or credential changes.,"With EDR, audit logs, and patching.",Hard to eradicate without full reimaging.,Not applicable—this is an attacker tactic.
Privilege Escalation,Gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network.,"Exploits misconfigurations, unpatched flaws, or credential theft.",To gain admin/root access for broader impact.,"With PAM, patching, and principle of least privilege.",Often overlooked in internal audits.,Not applicable—attacker technique.
Defense Evasion,Techniques used to avoid detection and bypass security controls.,"Includes obfuscation, disabling logs, or polymorphic code.",To remain undetected within target systems.,With behavioral analytics and real-time monitoring.,Often sophisticated and evolving.,Not a legitimate use—attacker tactic.
Credential Access,Attempting to steal account names and passwords.,"Via keyloggers, phishing, dumping hashes, or brute force.",To enable lateral movement or persistence.,"With MFA, password vaults, and monitoring.",Some techniques mimic normal user behavior.,Tactic by adversaries.
Discovery,Gaining knowledge about the environment after access is gained.,"Commands to enumerate users, systems, and privileges.",To plan lateral movement and attacks.,With least privilege and activity monitoring.,Many commands look like admin work.,Used by adversaries.
Lateral Movement,Moving through a network to access additional systems.,"Uses remote services, harvested credentials, or exploits.",To expand control and reach crown jewels.,"With segmentation, PAM, and EDR.",Hard to detect if credentials are valid.,Not used by defenders.
Collection,Gathering sensitive data from targeted systems.,"Keylogging, screenshotting, file scraping.",To prepare for data exfiltration.,"With DLP, encryption, and access control.",Attackers may blend in with normal data access.,Adversarial step.
Exfiltration,Transferring stolen data out of the network.,"Over FTP, HTTPS, cloud services, etc.",To complete the breach and monetize.,"With DLP, firewall rules, and monitoring.",Small volumes may go unnoticed.,This is a malicious tactic.
Impact,"Disrupting, damaging, or destroying systems or data.","Ransomware, wipers, data deletion.","For extortion, sabotage, or political goals.","With backups, segmentation, and response plans.",Damage is often irreversible.,Attack phase.
