                        Relationship' initial access (MITRE T1199). Once inside, weak internal segmentation allowed
                        attackers to move laterally from a low-value network segment to the highly sensitive
                        Point-of-Sale environment. Their RAM scraping malware wasn't detected, and the massive data
                        exfiltration went unnoticed for weeks. This highlights the failure of relying solely on
                        perimeter defenses and signature-based detection."</p>

                    <p><strong>A:</strong> Proper segmentation would have prevented the attackers, who initially gained
                        access to a less sensitive network zone (likely for vendor management), from being able to
                        directly reach or scan the POS systems in the PCI-controlled zone. It acts as a firewall

                        each role. Here, we're creating a role for EC2 instances that can only describe EC2 resources,
