# Threat Model Report

This report outlines potential threats identified by an automated scan of the CloudFormation template. **Manual review is essential** to validate these findings and assess risks in the context of the specific application.

## Resource: `InboundHTTPPublicNetworkAclEntry` (`AWS::EC2::NetworkAclEntry`)

### Threat 1: NACL Ingress rule allows traffic from/to anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) on port(s) 80 (Protocol: 6).

## Resource: `NATDevice` (`AWS::EC2::Instance`)

### Threat 1: Instance is potentially placed in a public subnet (Ref(PublicSubnet)).

- **STRIDE Categories:** I (Information Disclosure), S (Spoofing), D (Denial of Service), T (Tampering)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Ensure instances are placed in private subnets unless they explicitly require direct internet exposure (e.g., NAT Instances, Bastion Hosts). Use Load Balancers for public access to applications.


---

## Resource: `NATSecurityGroup` (`AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`)

### Threat 1: Ingress rule allows traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) on port(s) 80 (Protocol: tcp).

- **STRIDE Categories:** I (Information Disclosure), S (Spoofing), D (Denial of Service)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Restrict the CIDR range to known IPs or specific Security Groups. Avoid using 0.0.0.0/0 if possible, especially for sensitive ports.

- **STRIDE Categories:** I (Information Disclosure), S (Spoofing), D (Denial of Service)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Restrict the CIDR range to known IPs or specific Security Groups. Avoid using 0.0.0.0/0 if possible, especially for sensitive ports.

### Threat 3: Ingress rule allows traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) on port(s) 22 (Protocol: tcp).

### Threat 4: SSH Port (22) appears open to the internet (0.0.0.0/0).

- **STRIDE Categories:** S (Spoofing), E (Elevation of Privilege), I (Information Disclosure)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Strongly recommend restricting SSH access to specific bastion host IPs or known administrative networks. Use VPNs or Session Manager instead of direct SSH exposure.

## Resource: `BastionSecurityGroup` (`AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`)

### Threat 1: Ingress rule allows traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) on port(s) 22 (Protocol: tcp).

- **STRIDE Categories:** I (Information Disclosure), S (Spoofing), D (Denial of Service)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Restrict the CIDR range to known IPs or specific Security Groups. Avoid using 0.0.0.0/0 if possible, especially for sensitive ports.

## Resource: `PublicElasticLoadBalancer` (`AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer`)

### Threat 1: Load Balancer is internet-facing.

- **STRIDE Categories:** D (Denial of Service), S (Spoofing), I (Information Disclosure)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Ensure internet-facing ELBs are necessary. Consider using AWS WAF for protection. Ensure backend instances/security groups are appropriately secured.

### Threat 2: Load Balancer has an HTTP listener (Port: 80). Traffic is unencrypted.

- **STRIDE Categories:** I (Information Disclosure), T (Tampering)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Prefer HTTPS listeners for encrypted traffic. Use ACM to manage certificates. If HTTP is required, consider redirection to HTTPS.

## Resource: `PublicLoadBalancerSecurityGroup` (`AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`)

### Threat 1: Ingress rule allows traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) on port(s) 80 (Protocol: tcp).

- **STRIDE Categories:** I (Information Disclosure), S (Spoofing), D (Denial of Service)
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Restrict the CIDR range to known IPs or specific Security Groups. Avoid using 0.0.0.0/0 if possible, especially for sensitive ports.

## Resource: `PrivateElasticLoadBalancer` (`AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer`)

### Threat 1: Load Balancer is internal.

- **STRIDE Categories:** 
- **Potential Mitigation / Area to Review:** Ensure Security Groups associated with the internal ELB and its targets restrict traffic appropriately within the VPC.

### Threat 2: Load Balancer has an HTTP listener (Port: 80). Traffic is unencrypted.
