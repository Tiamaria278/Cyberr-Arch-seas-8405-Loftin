    "# Assignment: Designing Secure Architectures to Mitigate Historical Breaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In this assignment, you will analyze three major cybersecurity breaches—Equifax Data Breach (2017), SolarWinds Backdoor Attack (2020), and Capital One Data Breach (2019)—and design secure architectures to address their specific vulnerabilities. For each breach, you will:\n",
    "1. Create an architecture diagram using Python's `diagrams` module for a system in an environment of your choice (On-premises, AWS, or Azure).\n",
    "2. Develop three security architectures: **Defense in Depth (DiD)**, **Zero Trust**, and **Adaptive Security**, adapting your initial diagram for each.\n",
    "3. Explain your design decisions in a table format for each architecture.\n",
    "4. Submit your work in this notebook, including code, diagrams, and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "- **Python Diagramming Library**: Use the `diagrams` module (`pip install diagrams`) to programmatically create architecture diagrams.\n",
    "- **Environment**: Choose one of the following for your designs: On-premises, AWS, or Azure.\n",
    "- **Submission**: This notebook with all code, generated diagrams (e.g., PNG files), and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- **Setup**: Install the `diagrams` library with `!pip install diagrams` in a code cell.\n",
    "- **Diagrams**: Create a base architecture diagram for each breach, then adapt it for DiD, Zero Trust, and Adaptive Security.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Use markdown cells to describe your designs and tables to explain controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breach Scenarios\n",
    "### 1. Equifax Data Breach (2017)\n",
    "- **Unpatched Apache Struts Vulnerability**: Unpatched for 2+ months, allowed code execution.\n",
    "- **Lack of Network Segmentation**: Flat network enabled lateral movement to PII databases.\n",
    "- **Expired IDS Certificates**: Disabled intrusion detection for 10+ months.\n",
    "- **False Negatives in Scans**: Missed vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. SolarWinds Backdoor Attack (2020)\n",
    "- **Supply-Chain Compromise**: Backdoor in signed Orion updates infected 18,000+ customers.\n",
    "- **Anomalous Build Processes**: Compromised build environment injected malicious code.\n",
    "- **Insufficient Build Safeguards**: No tampering detection in the pipeline.\n",
    "- **Lack of Policy Enforcement**: No integrity checks for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Capital One Data Breach (2019)\n",
    "- **Cloud Misconfiguration (SSRF)**: Misconfigured WAF allowed metadata access.\n",
    "- **Over-Privileged IAM Roles**: Excessive permissions exposed 100+ S3 buckets.\n",
    "- **Inadequate Monitoring**: Failed to detect SSRF or data exfiltration.\n",
    "- **Compliance Gaps**: Weak IAM and configuration governance.\n",
